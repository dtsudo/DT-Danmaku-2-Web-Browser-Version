# How to compile the source code

This project uses Bridge.NET to compile the C# code into javascript. The Bridge CLI (https://github.com/bridgedotnet/CLI) needs to be installed so that we can run the Bridge compiler on the command line.

Once the Bridge CLI is installed, go to the source code folder and run `bridge build` to compile the C# code:

* `cd "Source code/DTDanmaku2/"`
* `bridge build`

This will generate a few files in the `Source code/DTDanmaku2/dist/` folder.

We also need the audio and image files:

* Copy the `Data` folder to `Source code/DTDanmaku2/dist/`

Then, to run the program, simply run `Source code/DTDanmaku2/dist/DT Danmaku 2.html` in a web browser.
